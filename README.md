# 🎥 imdbApi
A movie search website using the omdbApi for IMDb

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

This is still undergoing development, road map as follows:<br />

✔️ Successful response from ombdApi<br />
✔️ Initial grid system<br />
✔️ Individual information pages with ext. link to IMDb pages<br />
✔️ CSS that doesn't look terrible (hmm, still work in progress)<br />
✔️ My personal favourite films/shows (kinda done but may revisit)<br />
❌ Possible genre/category side column implemented on index.html, e.g. displaying top 25 rated films in each<br />
